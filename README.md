# VSCode Random Stuff

This repository contains a small Python chess project located in the `chess/` folder.

See `chess/README.md` for usage, installation instructions, and details about the GUI, AI, and engine integration.

If you want to run the chess app, open a terminal in the `chess/` directory and follow the steps in that README.

Enjoy!
# VSCode_Random_Stuff
There is a lot of AI use in this project mainly to see how far I can push it with something as complicated as Chess.
This repository currently contains a small Python chess demo (GUI + basic AI).

Files added:
- `main.py` — a tkinter-based chess GUI that uses `python-chess` for game logic and a small negamax AI.
- `requirements.txt` — lists `python-chess`.
- `.gitignore` — ignores virtualenv and cache files.

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
# VSCode_Random_Stuff

This workspace contains multiple small experiments. The chess demo and framework have been moved into the `chess/` folder so you can reuse it as a template for other projects.

Open `chess/README.md` for full instructions on running the chess demo and using the engine downloader / verifier.
