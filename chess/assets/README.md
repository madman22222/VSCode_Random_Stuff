Assets for piece images

Place PNG piece images in this folder if you want graphical pieces instead of Unicode characters.

Expected filenames (lowercase):
- wp.png (white pawn)
- wn.png (white knight)
- wb.png (white bishop)
- wr.png (white rook)
- wq.png (white queen)
- wk.png (white king)
- bp.png (black pawn)
- bn.png (black knight)
- bb.png (black bishop)
- br.png (black rook)
- bq.png (black queen)
- bk.png (black king)

Images should be roughly square. The GUI will resize to 64x64.

You can get free chess piece PNGs from many open-source icon packs. Place them here and restart the app.
