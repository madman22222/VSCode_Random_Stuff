# Chess Sound Files

This directory contains sound effects for the chess application.

## Sound Files Needed:
- `move.wav` - Regular piece move sound
- `capture.wav` - Piece capture sound (more dramatic)
- `check.wav` - Check notification sound
- `checkmate.wav` - Game-ending checkmate sound
- `castle.wav` - Castling move sound
- `illegal.wav` - Illegal move attempt sound

## Creating Sounds:
You can create simple WAV files using:
1. Online tools like: https://sfxr.me/ or https://www.bfxr.net/
2. Recording and editing with Audacity
3. Downloading from free sound libraries (freesound.org, zapsplat.com)

## Fallback:
If sound files are missing, the application will use Windows system beeps for important events (check, checkmate, illegal moves).
